Located amidst the picturesque landscape of Thuy Ba village, Thuy Xuan ward, Hue, the mausoleum was built from 1864 and completed in 1873. This is the resting place of King Tu Duc - the longest reigning king of the Nguyen Dynasty, famous for his poetic soul and love of nature.

The special feature of the mausoleum is that nearly 50 large and small constructions all have the word "Khiem" in their names, such as Khiem Cung Mon, Hoa Khiem Palace, Luu Khiem Lake, Xung Khiem Ta... The space is harmoniously arranged between the royal architecture and the landscape of the lake and pine hills, creating a feeling of both majesty and poetry.
