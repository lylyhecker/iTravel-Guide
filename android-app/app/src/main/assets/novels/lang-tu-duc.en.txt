Dusk settled over Tu Duc Tomb as gentle winds rippled the surface of Luu Khiem Lake. Minh, a young painter, set his easel on the shore, hoping to capture the last lilac light of the season. In the stillness he imagined old verses drifting from the pavilion in the center of the lake.

Legend said that on every full moon, the emperor returned upon a cloud-woven dragon boat, reciting poems to the trees. Minh closed his eyes and pictured the royal figure standing amid lantern flowers. When he opened them again, a pair of kingfishers skimmed the water, leaving widening circles behind.

The canvas slowly revealed more than scenery; it became a dialogue between past and present. Minh realized that the novel he longed to write would chronicle the search for beauty within silence, where Tu Duc's dreams mingled with the morning mist.
