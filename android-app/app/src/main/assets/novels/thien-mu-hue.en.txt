At dawn, the bells of Thien Mu Pagoda drifted across the still water of the Perfume River. Dang sat beneath the crape myrtle tree, opening his notebook to capture the legends his grandmother whispered at night. Today he vowed to continue the tale of the novice who saved the village from a flood with a prayer.

Looking up, Dang spotted the abbot scattering grains of rice for sparrows. The elder smiled and spoke of the Phuoc Duyen tower, standing guard over Hue's dreams for centuries. To Dang, the tower resembled a giant pen scripting sutras onto the sky.

Words on the page slowly became a promise: one day Dang would write his own novel, telling of the river's breath, the chimes of Thien Mu, and the gentle people who lived around the ancient pagoda.
